Here I trained the agent with continuous action space and fixed
some problems in the environment related to waits. Results were
good and the agent seemed to learn simple strategy of going backwards,
doing circles while trying to aim and hit the zombies. The important
think to mention here is that the current scenario is difficult
because agent is equipped with only a stone sword and without armor.
Stone sword is a little better than the worst sword in Minecraft.
